Although I am doing side projects everyday, sometimes I was pround of what I could do.... After seeing the stories here,
I should always remember that, no matter how hard I am working, there are many people far better than me. 
So, keep being humble but also keep being positive!
Their stories are insipring! And maybe I could find opportunites to return back to Seattle :)

 * I really like this story, the author does not sound as arrogant as many other developers/"data science" people, words looks honest. This company looks so cools! I'd rather work as their developer... And I really want to return back to Seattle....
